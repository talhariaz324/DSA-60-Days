edge cases: when input is wrong. Then we modify the code by adding if's

like if(num < 0){
    num = 0
}else if(num > arr.length - 1){ // length is 7 and index are 0 to 6

    num = arr.length - 1;
}


Linear Search: Check the array in sequence as they are consecutive.

NOTE: We use while loop when we have to use 2 indexes in condition. While loop continues till the condition met.
we need the 2 indexes in the binary search.
NOTE: Array should be sorted in binary search.

Binary Search: Binary Search is used to reduce the working. Previously we were using the linear search which checks each element in the array.
But Binary search says we can find by finding the mid of array and then check either target(to find) is less than the arr.length - 1. If less than
then mean our target value would be next from mid. Again do the same. 1- Find mid from previous mid + 1 till arr.length - 1
It would do that until the target found.


FORMULA: Left start + Right start /2 
If not found then 
left would be mid  + 1
